# Design system

Cipher Lab is built on the a11y-charts system: Geist, monochrome ink on white, true black in dark mode. State is shown with ink weight, rules and shape, never a brand color.

## Tokens (`src/styles/tokens.css`)

| Token | Light | Dark | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--bg` | #ffffff | #0a0a0a | Page and panel background |
| `--bg-subtle` | #fafafa | #111111 | Bars, badges, hover wash |
| `--bg-hover` | #f2f2f2 | #1a1a1a | Hover and selected rows |
| `--ink` | #171717 | #ededed | Text, primary button, active marks |
| `--ink-soft` | #666666 | #a1a1a1 | Secondary text |
| `--ink-faint` | #737373 | #8a8a8a | Labels, table headers |
| `--rule` | #ebebeb | #242424 | Hairlines |
| `--rule-strong` | #d4d4d4 | #3a3a3a | Control borders, frame edge |
| `--focus` | #0068d6 | #52a8ff | Focus ring only |
| `--on-ink` | #ffffff | #0a0a0a | Text on solid ink |

Type: Geist 400/500/600 for everything; Geist Mono for IDs, addresses, kickers and badges. Body 15px/1.6. Page title 32–44px, weight 600, letter-spacing −0.045em; hero title 44–72px, −0.055em.

Theme follows the OS until the person picks one with the header toggle (stored in `localStorage` as `cl-theme`).

## Components

### BrowserFrame

`src/components/BrowserFrame.tsx` and `src/styles/browser-frame.css`.

A plain browser window for presenting an app inside a page: a product demo, a prototype, a case study. The app inside reads as the product, the page around it as the story.

```tsx
import BrowserFrame, { useFrameHistory } from './components/BrowserFrame';

function Demo() {
  const { pathname, nav, menuOpen, setMenuOpen, scrollRef } = useFrameHistory();
  return (
    <BrowserFrame.Stage>
      <BrowserFrame
        host="cipherlab.app"
        path={pathname}
        nav={nav}
        menu={{ open: menuOpen, onToggle: () => setMenuOpen((o) => !o), controls: 'sidebar' }}
        end={<Avatar />}
      >
        <div className="my-app">…</div>
      </BrowserFrame>
    </BrowserFrame.Stage>
  );
}
```

| Prop | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | Shown after the host in the address bar |
| `host` | Address host, default `cipherlab.app` |
| `nav` | Back / Forward buttons; `useFrameHistory()` supplies one |
| `menu` | Menu button for small screens; `controls` is the id of the panel it opens |
| `end` | Right end of the bar, such as an avatar |

Rules:

- **Fill the viewport.** `BrowserFrame.Stage` sizes the frame to the height under the site header. The page itself never scrolls; the app's own regions scroll inside the frame.
- **90% on wide screens.** From 1280px up, the frame takes 90% of the width and 90% of the height under the header, centered, so it reads as a framed product with even space around it. Below 1280px it fills the space with a 16px gutter (8px under 520px), because room inside matters more there.
- **Everything stays inside.** Back and Forward only move through pages visited in the frame, so Back never leaves it. Panels opened from the bar (like the small-screen menu) render inside the frame body, which is the positioning context.
- **Keep the bar quiet.** The window dots are decoration and hidden from assistive tech. Back, Forward and Menu are real buttons with names; the address is read-only text.
- **Small screens.** Below 960px the menu button appears; below 520px the dots and host hide so the path keeps its room.

Tunables: `--bframe-gutter` (below 1280px), `--bframe-radius`, `--bframe-bar-h`. The component reads only the shared tokens above, so it drops into any project that uses them.
